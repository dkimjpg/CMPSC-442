# About this repository:
This is my repository for the homework that I worked on for CMPSC 442 - Artificial Intelligence.

I didn't need to use GitHub to submit homework for this class this time, so I decided to try using GitHub on my own to see how well it goes. 
I've already worked with GitHub since my freshman year of college since I had to use it to submit labs, but now that I don't need to use it for any other classes, I'm just doing it so I don't lose touch 
with using Git version control.

~~and also so my GitHub page looks better~~

Anyway, I'm not used to making readme markdown files \(or README.md files if you prefer\), so I'm also using this as practice to get used to writing them. 

**But really, most of this markdown file formatting stuff can be looked up anyway, so it's not exactly the most impressive thing in the world. But it's better than a blank README.md page, I guess.**
