# About this repository:
This is my repository for the homework that I worked on for CMPSC 442 - Artificial Intelligence.

I didn't need to use GitHub to submit homework for this class this time, so I decided to try using GitHub on my own to see how well it goes. 
I've already worked with GitHub since my freshman year of college since I had to use it to submit labs, but now that I don't need to use it for any other classes, I'm just doing it so I don't lose touch 
with using Git version control.

~~and also so my GitHub page looks better~~

Anyway, I'm not used to making readme markdown files \(or README.md files if you prefer\), so I'm also using this as practice to get used to writing them. 

**But really, most of this markdown file formatting stuff can be looked up anyway, so it's not exactly the most impressive thing in the world. But it's better than a blank README.md page, I guess.**

# The topics that are covered in this class:
~~I'll probably update this as I get further in the class, but that's only if I remember to do so. But for the most part, this is here to explain what topics the homework covers.~~
Quick note: The homework covered specific topics, but also blended a few other topics together. I just put down the main topics that a homework assignment was related to. And also, 
homework 3 was an entirely different kind of assignment where it was done with a partner on a website made by the professor's TAs. I think we were training AI models through it. Interesting,
but it's not something I can really put on here since it doesn't belong to me.
- [x] Intelligent Agents
- [x] Search
- [x] Uninformed Search \(_Homework 1_\)
- [x] Informed Search \(_Homework 2_\)
- [x] Games and Adversarial Search
- [x] Non-classical Search
- [x] Constraint Satisfaction Problem
- [x] Logic Agents \(_Homework 4_\)
- [x] Probabilistic Agents \(_Homework 5_\)
- [x] Hidden Markov Models \(_Homework 6_\)
- [x] Markov Decision Processes
- [x] Reinforcement Learning
- [x] Machine Learning
- [x] Neural Networks and Backpropagation
- [x] Large Language Models
- [x] AI Ethics 

Well, now that I've finished all the assignments for this course, they were all really tough. I'm not sure how other AI companies actually implement their AI models, but I hope this is a good starting point for me to
get experience with AI. Other than that, I just have the final exam left to cover. Hopefully, that will go well.
